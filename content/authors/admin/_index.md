I’m a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of  Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a data science specialization at Rice University, in the multicultural city of Houston. I am currently co-advised by Dr Ankit Patel and Dr Arvind Rao, who is based at the University of Michigan, where I am currently a visiting student. I’m interested in leveraging Machine Learning and statistical methods to develop sound frameworks that could be used to improve disease prediction and prognosis, especially in the cancer domain.

Along with my research, I am also quite active in mentoring younger lab members, as well as undergraduate and high school students that rotate in our lab. I have also been part of multiple organizational committees, including the new graduate student orientation committees for 2016 and 2018, and ISAR.
